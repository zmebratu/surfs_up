# surfs_up

## Purpose 
The objective of the current project is to analyze Hawaii's weather data to determine the feasibility of opening a shop that serves surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists on this beautiful island. Precipitation levels must also be considered, as there needs to be enough rain to keep the environment green, but not so much that it is unsuitable for surfing and enjoying ice cream.

The purpose of the analysis is to attract investors with visualizations of a full year's data. To display this analytics, we used a Jupyter Notebook File and a SQLite database as our tools.

## Results
* The minimum temperature in December is 56
* The average temperature in December is 71
* The average temperature in June is 74

## Summary

## Suggestion of additional analysis
Hawaii only has two weather stations, one for summer and one for winter, but even during the winter season, the weather is mild and there is no cold weather. Therefore, locals and tourists visit the island all year round, making it an excellent location for this type of startup. With proper organization and administration, this business has great potential for growth in the region.
